==================================================
Enhance Power Interface for Soft Power Off and NMI
==================================================

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1526226

The proposal presents the work required to enhance the power
interface to support soft reboot and soft power off, and the
management interface to support diagnostic interrupt (NMI [1]).


Problem description
===================
There exists a problem in the current driver interface which doesn't
provide with soft power off and diagnostic interrupt (NMI [1])
capabilities even though ipmitool [2] and most of BMCs support these
capabilities.

Here is a part of ipmitool man page in which describes soft power off and
diagnostic interrupt (NMI [1]).

$ man ipmitool::

 ...
 power

        Performs a chassis control command to view and change the
        power state.

        ...

        diag

               Pulse a diagnostic interrupt (NMI) directly to the
               processor(s).

        soft

               Initiate a soft-shutdown of OS via ACPI. This can be
               done in a number of ways, commonly by simulating an
               overtemperature or by simulating a power button press.
               It is necessary for there to be Operating System
               support for ACPI and some sort of daemon watching for
               events for this soft power to work.

From customer's point of view, both tenant admin and tenant user, the
lack of the soft power off and diagnostic interrupt (NMI [1]) lead the
following inconveniences.

1. Customer cannot safely shutdown or soft power off their instance
   without logging on.

2. Customer cannot take NMI dump to investigate OS related problem by
   themselves.

From deployer's point of view, that is cloud provider, the lack of the
two capabilities leads the following inconveniences.

1. Cloud provider support staff cannot shutdown customer's instance
   safely without logging on for hardware maintenance reason or etc.

2. Cloud provider support staff cannot ask customer to take NMI dump
   as one of investigation materials.


Proposed change
===============
In order to solve the problems described in the previous section,
this spec proposes to enhance the power states, the PowerInterface
base class and the ManagementInterface base class so that each driver
can implement to initiate soft reboot, soft power off and inject NMI.

And this enhancement enables the soft reboot, soft power off and
inject NMI through Ironic CLI and REST API for tenant admin and cloud
provider. Also this enhancement enables them through Nova CLI and REST
API for tenant user when Nova's blueprint [3] is implemented.

As a reference implementation, this spec also proposes to implement
the enhanced PowerInterface base class into the IPMIPower concrete
class and the enhanced ManagementInterface base class into the
IPMIManagement concrete class.


1. add the following new power states to ironic.common.states::

    SOFT_REBOOT = 'soft rebooting'
    SOFT_POWER_OFF = 'soft power off'

2. add "get_supported_power_states" method and its default implementation
   to the base PowerInterface class in ironic/drivers/base.py::

    def get_supported_power_states(self, task):
        """Get a list of the supported power states.

        :param task: A TaskManager instance containing the node to act on.
        :returns: A list of the supported power states defined
                  in :mod:`ironic.common.states`.
        """
        return [states.POWER_ON, states.POWER_OFF, states.REBOOT]

   * Note: WakeOnLanPower driver supports only states.POWER_ON.

3. add a default parameter ``timeout`` into the "set_power_state"
   method in to the base PowerInterface class in ironic/drivers/base.py::

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def set_power_state(self, task, power_state, timeout=None):
        """Set the power state of the task's node.

        :param task: a TaskManager instance containing the node to act on.
        :param power_state: Any power state from :mod:`ironic.common.states`.
        :param timeout: timeout positive integer (> 0) for any power state.
           ``None`` indicates to use default timeout which depends on
           ``power_state``[*]_ and driver.
        :raises: MissingParameterValue if a required parameter is missing.
        """

   .. [*] The default timeout for ``SOFT_REBOOT`` and ``SOFT_POWER_OFF``
          can be configured in the Ironic configuration file,
          typically /etc/ironic/ironic.conf, as follows::

           [conductor]
           # This section defines generic default timeout values.
           #
           # timeout (in seconds) of soft reboot and soft power off operation.
           # This value always has to be positive(> 0).
           # (integer value)
           soft_power_off_timeout = 600

4. enhance "set_power_state" method in IPMIPower class so that the
   new states can be accepted as "power_state" parameter.

   IPMIPower reference implementation supports SOFT_REBOOT and
   SOFT_POWER_OFF.

   SOFT_REBOOT is implemented by first SOFT_POWER_OFF and then a plain POWER_ON
   such that Ironic implemented REBOOT. This implementation enables
   generic BMC detect the reboot completion as the power state change
   from ON -> OFF -> ON which power transition is called ``power cycle``.

   The following table shows power state value of each state variables.
   ``new_state`` is a value of the second parameter of set_power_state()
   function.
   ``power_state`` is a value of node property.
   ``target_power_state`` is a value of node property.

   +-----------------+--------------+--------------------+--------------+
   |new_state        | power_state  | target_power_state | power_state  |
   |                 | (start state)| (assigned value)   | (end state)  |
   +-----------------+--------------+--------------------+--------------+
   |SOFT_REBOOT      | POWER_ON     | SOFT_POWER_OFF     | POWER_OFF[*]_|
   |                 | POWER_OFF[*]_| POWER_ON           | POWER_ON     |
   |SOFT_REBOOT      | POWER_OFF    | POWER_ON           | POWER_ON     |
   |SOFT_POWER_OFF   | POWER_ON     | SOFT_POWER_OFF     | POWER_OFF    |
   |SOFT_POWER_OFF   | POWER_OFF    | NONE               | POWER_OFF    |
   +-----------------+--------------+--------------------+--------------+

   .. [*] intermediate state of ``power cycle``.
          SOFT_REBOOT is implemented as power cycle such as REBOOT.

    In case that timeout or error occurred when the new_state is set
    to either SOFT_REBOOT or SOFT_POWER_OFF, the end state becomes
    ERROR for logging.

   +-----------------+--------------+--------------------+--------------+
   |new_state        | power_state  | target_power_state | power_state  |
   |                 | (start state)| (assigned value)   | (end state)  |
   +-----------------+--------------+--------------------+--------------+
   |SOFT_REBOOT      | POWER_ON     | SOFT_POWER_OFF     | ERROR[*]_    |
   |SOFT_POWER_OFF   | POWER_ON     | SOFT_POWER_OFF     | ERROR[*]_    |
   +-----------------+--------------+--------------------+--------------+

   .. [*] ERROR state will be overwritten by periodic sync power
          status task.


5. add "get_supported_power_states" method and implementation in
   IPMIPower::

    def get_supported_power_states(self, task):
        """Get a list of the supported power states.

        :param task: A TaskManager instance containing the node to act on.
           currently not used.
        :returns: A list of the supported power states defined
                  in :mod:`ironic.common.states`.
        """

        return [states.POWER_ON, states.POWER_OFF, states.REBOOT,
                states.SOFT_REBOOT, states.SOFT_POWER_OFF]

6. add "inject_nmi" abstract method to the base ManagementInterface
   class in ironic/drivers/base.py::

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def inject_nmi(self, task):
        """Inject NMI, Non Maskable Interrupt.

        :param task: A TaskManager instance containing the node to act on.
        :returns: None
        """

7. add "inject_nmi" concrete method implementation in IPMIManagement
   class.


Alternatives
------------
* Both the soft power off and diagnostic interrupt (NMI [1]) could be
  implemented by vendor passthru. However the proposed change is
  better than the vendor passthru, because users of Ironic API or
  Ironic CLI can write script or program uniformly.


Data model impact
-----------------
None


State Machine Impact
--------------------
None


REST API impact
---------------
* Add support of SOFT_REBOOT and SOFT_POWER_OFF to the target
  parameter of following API::

   PUT /v1/nodes/(node_ident)/states/power

   The target parameter supports the following JSON data respectively.
   ``timeout`` is an optional parameter for any ``target`` parameter.
   In case of "soft reboot" and "soft power off", ``timeout`` overrides
   ``soft_power_off_timeout`` in the in the Ironic configuration file,
   typically /etc/ironic/ironic.conf.

   Examples

     {"target": "soft reboot",
      "timeout": 900}

     {"target": "soft power off",
      "timeout": 600}

* Add a new management API to support inject NMI::

   PUT /v1/nodes/(node_ident)/management/inject_nmi

   Request doesn't take any parameter.


Client (CLI) impact
-------------------
* Enhance Ironic CLI "ironic node-set-power-state" to support power
  graceful off/reboot by adding optional arguments.
  This CLI is async. In order to get the latest status,
  call "ironic node-show-states" and check the returned value.::

   usage: ironic node-set-power-state <node> <power-state>
          [--soft] [--timeout <timeout>]

   Power a node on/off/reboot, power graceful off/reboot to a node.

   Positional arguments

   <node>

       Name or UUID of the node.

   <power-state>

       'on', 'off', 'reboot'

   Optional arguments:
      --soft
        power graceful off/reboot.

      --timeout <timeout>
        timeout positive integer value(> 0) for any ``power-state``.
        If ``--soft`` option is also specified, it overrides
        ``soft_power_off_timeout`` in the in the Ironic configuration
        file, typically /etc/ironic/ironic.conf.


* Add a new Ironic CLI "ironic node-inject-nmi" to support inject nmi.
  This CLI is async. In order to get the latest status, serial console
  access is required.::

   usage: ironic node-inject-nmi <node>

   Inject NMI, Non Maskable Interrupt.

   Positional arguments

   <node>

       Name or UUID of the node.

* Enhance OSC plugin "openstack baremetal node" so that the parameter
  can accept 'reboot [--soft] [--timeout <timeout>]', 'power [on|off
  [--soft] [--timeout <timeout>]' and 'inject nmi'.
  This CLI is async. In order to get the latest status,
  call "openstack baremetal node show" and check the returned value.::

   usage: openstack baremetal node reboot [--soft] [--timeout <timeout>] <uuid>

   usage: openstack baremetal node power off [--soft] [--timeout <timeout>] <uuid>

   usage: openstack baremetal node inject nmi <uuid>

RPC API impact
--------------
None


Driver API impact
-----------------
PowerInterface base and ManagementInterface base are enhanced by
adding a new method respectively as described in the section "Proposed
change".
And these enhancements keep API backward compatible.
Therefore it doesn't have any risk to break out of tree drivers.


Nova driver impact
------------------
The default behavior of "nova reboot" command to a virtual machine
instance such as KVM is soft reboot.
And "nova reboot" command has a option '--hard' to indicate hard reboot.

However the default behavior of "nova reboot" to an Ironic instance
is hard reboot, and --hard option is meaningless to the Ironic instance.

Therefore Ironic Nova driver needs to be update to unify the behavior
between virtual machine instance and bare-metal instance.

This problem is reported as a bug [6]. How to fix this problem is
specified in nova blueprint [10] and spec [11].

The default behavior change of "nova reboot" command is made by
following the standard deprecation policy [12]. How to deprecate nova
command is also specified in nova blueprint [10] and spec [11].


Ramdisk impact
--------------
None


Security impact
---------------
None


Other end user impact
---------------------
None


Scalability impact
------------------
None


Performance Impact
------------------
None


Other deployer impact
---------------------
* Deployer, cloud provider, needs to set up ACPI [7] and NMI [1]
  capable bare metal servers in cloud environment.

* change the default timeout value (sec) in the Ironic configuration
  file, typically /etc/ironic/ironic.conf if necessary.


Developer impact
----------------
* Each driver developer needs to follow this interface to implement
  this proposed feature.


Implementation
==============

Assignee(s)

Primary assignee:
  Naohiro Tamura (naohirot)

Other contributors:
  None


Work Items
----------
* Enhance PowerInterface class and  ManagementInterface class to
  support soft power off and inject nmi [1] as described "Proposed
  change".

* Enhance Ironic API as described in "REST API impact".

* Enhance Ironic CLI as described in "Client (CLI) impact".

* Implement the enhanced PowerInterface class into the concrete class
  IPMIPower, and the enhanced ManagementInterface class into the
  concrete class IPMIManagement.
  Implementing vendor's concrete class is up to each vendor.

* Coordinate the work with Nova NMI support "Inject NMI to an
  instance" [3] if necessary.

* Update the deployer documentation from the ironic perspective.


Dependencies
============
* Soft power off control depends on ACPI [7]. In case of Linux system,
  acpid [8] has to be installed. In case of Windows system, local
  security policy has to be set as described in "Shutdown: Allow
  system to be shut down without having to log on" [9].

* NMI [1] reaction depends on Kernel Crash Dump Configuration. How to
  set up the kernel dump can be found for Linux system in [13], [14], and
  for Windows in [15].

Testing
=======
* Unit Tests.

* Tempest Tests, at least soft reboot/soft power off.

* Each vendor plans Third Party CI Tests if implemented.


Upgrades and Backwards Compatibility
====================================
None (Forwards Compatibility is out of scope)

* Note
  The backwards compatibility issue of the default behavior change of
  "nova reboot" command is solved by following the standard deprecation
  policy [12].


Documentation Impact
====================
* The deployer doc and REST API reference manual need to be updated.
  (CLI manual is generated automatically from source code)
