Huawei iBMC Driver

This specification proposes to add new interfaces that provide Ironic support
to Huawei iBMC 2288H V5, CH121 V5 series servers.

Problem description
===================

Huaweiâ€™s Intelligent Baseboard Management System (iBMC) is an embedded server
management system that is used to manage servers throughout their lifecycle.
It provides a series of management tools for hardware status monitoring,
deployment, energy savings, and security protection.

In addition to managing the nodes using IPMI protocol, this specification
proposes to add hardware types and interfaces to manage Huawei servers using
iBMC REST API.

Proposed change
===============
New hardware type named *ibmc* will be added as part of this change.
New power, management and vendor interfaces will be implemented for
the *ibmc* hardware.

The interfaces use iBMC REST API to communicate with iBMC.
The interfaces used are:

    * iBMC.IBMCPower for Power operations
    * iBMC.IBMCManagement for Management operations
    * iBMC.IBMCVendor for Vendorspecific operations

* Power:

  This feature allows the user to turn the node on/off or reboot by using the
  power interface which will in turn call iBMC REST API.

* Management:

  This feature allows the user to get and set the primary boot device of the
  Huawei servers, and to get the supported boot devices.

* Vendor:

  This feature allows the user to perform vendor specific operations.
  For example, query the boot up sequence of the Huawei servers.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ openstack baremetal node passthru call --http-method GET \
    <node id or node name> boot_up_seq
  $ ["Pxe", "Hdd", "Cd", "Others"]
